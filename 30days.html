            <p>We're seeking individuals who are committed to putting in dedicated hard work, demonstrating 110% commitment to our company, and sharing a strong desire to achieve rapid financial success. We're looking for those who are willing to invest tireless effort throughout an entire month to become pioneers within our company and future leaders.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="oppo-banner-footer">
            <p>If you're hesitant, looking to test the waters, or just considering giving it a try without complete commitment, this might not be suitable for you. We encourage you to stop reading for your own benefit. This opportunity is reserved for "the ones" who will inspire curiosity tomorrow, questioning how they achieved their remarkable position.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-center">For those select individuals, our rewards go beyond a mere percentage of sales or an exclusive contract that other companies often hand out, leading to confusion when they move elsewhere. We're offering something far more exceptional. For our valiant heroes who stand at Rank 4 to Rank 8, who champion hard work and believe in their capabilities, we have an extraordinary offer.</p>

          <p class="tagline">we will match the total sales volume of your entire organization from Rank 4 to Rank 8</p>
          <p>Yes, you read that right; your grasp of English is accurate, and Google translation skills are on point.</p>
          <p class="info-btn">We'll precisely match the sales volume produced during this period.</p>
          <p class="tagline color-green">This incredible bonus complements our world-class commission plan and a one-time advance payment for rank qualification.</p>

          <p class="tagline color-green">Let's put this into perspective with numbers</p>
          <p>For instance, if you achieve 1 million in sales calculated across all levels of your downline, we will reward you with a matching 1 million. This is in addition to the unilevel and infinity bonuses, as well as any rank advancement bonuses you qualify for.</p>
          <p>If you achieve rank 6, your first-month qualification costs for the company, amount to roughly 25% of your structure's total sales reserved exclusively for you! We could use numerous words to describe this remarkable bonus, but we prefer to let the numbers do the talking (Examples follow).</p>
          <p>Remember to carefully review all asterisks and fine print (actually none, just read <strong>“Payout rules”</strong> and “Requirement” below ) as true wealth is never acquired without effort, and we are committed to ensuring responsible financial management at Aladino, safeguarding the interests of our affiliates and customers.</p>

            <li>
              <p>
                The contest period begins on
                <strong>October 1st at 00:01</strong> when sales start, and the bonus accumulation begins concurrently.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The contest concludes on <strong>November 1st at 00:01</strong>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The bonuses will be distributed in equal parts <strong>over 12 months</strong>. These instalments will be paid in USDT and will reflect in your back office.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The first instalment will be credited to your back office wallet on <strong>December 1st</strong>, precisely 30 days after the contest's conclusion.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Each monthly instalment will be calculated at <strong>10%</strong> of the volume achieved during the current month. For instance, if you qualified for the 1 million bonus, the expected monthly instalment would be <strong>$83,333.3333</strong>. However, if your current monthly volume is lower than the qualifying period's volume, your payment will reflect this decrease. For instance, if your November 1st to December 1st total volume is <strong>$700k</strong>, your payment will amount to <strong>$70k</strong> in your wallet.</p>
              <p>Conversely, if your network's growth causes your GV to rise from 1 million (the qualifying month) to 3 million in December, your payment will be <strong>$300k</strong>.</p>
              <p>If the volume further increases to 5 million the next month, you will receive <strong>$500k</strong>. Consequently, the total amount paid out of the 1 million will now be <strong>$800k</strong>. In the following month, even if your volume remains at 5 million, your 10% instalment should be $500k, right?... not quite! You've already received <strong>$800k</strong>, so the remaining portion will be <strong>$200k</strong>, and we will conclude the process on a positive note.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Nope, hold your horses! This contest is like a dazzling fireworks show –spectacular but a one-time deal. It's designed to kick the company and yournetwork into high gear, but it's so lavish that even the finest financial mindscouldn't cram it into the usual bonus structure. Think of it as a champagnefountain at a lemonade stand – it's an expense the company won't recoup fromsales percentages. So, to keep it real, this is a "blink and you'll miss it" affair, like acomet streaking through the night sky.</p>

              <div class="faq__item">
                <h4 class="accordion">Why is the bonus paid out over a year rather than immediately?</h4>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>It's all about financial feasibility. Consider this: if someone achieves 10million in sales, that would mean a 10 million bonus. Now, let's take it up a notch –imagine hitting 100 million in sales. That's a whopping 100 million bonus. Buthere's the catch: to pay out these hefty sums along with the miners purchase,commission plan and additional expenses would require a cash infusion of 100million plus another 65 million for the commission plan plus another 70 million atlasts for miners acquisition. It's like trying to fill a bucket with an ocean.Financially, it's a puzzle that doesn't quite fit. So, to keep things sustainable, thebonus is spaced out over 12 months. Practicality prevails!</p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Simple. You will find 300k USDT in your Backoffice wallet rather than 83k.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Not faire , that’s not a questions is a dangerous statement ! Let's break it down. This bonus isn't designed for the dabbler or the part-timer. It's a red-carpet rollout for those who want to step into the future leadership of Aladino, not for those testing the waters or dipping a toe in the pool. Now, here's the scoop. This bonus isn't for the faint of heart; it's for those with the eye of the tiger, the ambition of a rocket, and the need for speed. It's like saying, "Hey, if you're ready to become a millionaire at a pace that makes the Flash look like a snail, step right up!" This bonus is the turbo boost for those who mean business, who want to see their name in lights, and who don't plan on waiting around for a slow-motion montage. So, is it challenging? Absolutely. But for th ego-getters, the dream-chasers, and the unstoppable, it's a challenge they're ready to tackle head-on!</p>

                <h4 class="accordion">Introducing the 40% rule</h4>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>it functions like a financial guardrail, preventing outright chaos. While it doesn't entirely eliminate this maneuver, it acts as a buffer. Crunching numbers, we've discovered that even if we were to soften the rule to 50%, it might appear to be a slight 10% shift. Yet, it generates an exponential effect, multiplying the impact by 2.5 times. Simply put, a 50% rule alteration wouldn't just slightly increase the challenge by 10%; it would magnify the consequences by paying out 2.5 million dollars out of 1 million sales.. This adjustment could push us towards the precipice of bankruptcy, perhaps not immediately, but in the following months.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Good question! Think of it like a firework – it's spectacular but burns outfast. The 30-day limit is like a safety net, preventing the company from doing thefinancial limbo and ending up in a tricky spot. The company's financial health andavoiding bankruptcy are the MVPs here. So, while we'd love to stretch it like arubber band, the 30-day cap keeps things exciting and secure.</p>

                <h4 class="accordion">If immediate payout wasn't feasible, why did you opt for thisapproach?</h4>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Excellent question! We're not just your run-of-the-mill company; we've got grand visions. We're all about building mining factories, nurturing long-term profits, and sharing the spoils with those who helped lay the foundation. We've got a distinct style – no paying "leaders" to simply join the party like some startups do. We know the deal: those kinds of payouts attract mercenaries who chase dollars, not dreams. And guess what? Once they're flush with cash, they bid adieu for greener pastures. We're wise to this game, and so are you. This scenario is the market norm – distributors crave quicker money and a safety net for the future. They're tired of being yanked around, leaping from one ship to the next and justifying their twists and turns to their networks.</p>
                  <p>So, we've cooked up a bonus that's like a 12-month salary on training wheels. It's not for an elite club of leaders; it's for every distributor in the game. It's like saying, "Hey, take your destiny into your hands for the next year!" And brace yourself, because this is the worst-case scenario: 12 months of solid company backing. But wait, there's more! In the best-case scenario, your Group Volume (GV) surges, month after month. Your 1 million, 2.5 million, or 10 million will come a-knockin' even faster. Who knows, in just ¾ of a year, you might be twiddling your thumbs as a millionaire (we're rootin' for you – you deserve it!). And while all this is brewing, the commission plan and ROI commissions are still part of the mix. It's like a buffet of awesomeness – you're not just getting one dish, you're getting the whole spread.</p>

                <h4 class="accordion">What's the rationale behind the 40% rule?</h4>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>A valid inquiry! Consider this: if we were to remove all constraints, youcould theoretically set up 3 or 4 sequential accounts, one below the other. Then,you'd initiate signups under the 4th account, achieving the $1 millionrequirement, thus earning a $1 million bonus. However, the twist emerges whenyou realize the remaining 3 accounts would also each claim a $1 million bonus,tallying up to a total payout of $4 million from $1 million in sales.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <p>No need to fret, brave soul! Even if the bonus feels like a stretch, you're still in for a treat. We've got the simplest and mightiest commission plan in town, ready to roll out the red carpet for you. Plus, there's the "rank advancement bonus" eagerly waiting to be your guide from the starting line of your journey. It's like having a supportive hand to pull you out of the pit of financial woes. So, while the bonus might be a star in the sky, there's a constellation of opportunities ready to light your path with Aladino commission plan</p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Absolutely, let's break it down using the example of the 1 million dollar qualification (rank 6).Imagine you have only 2 lines. Could you qualify with this setup? Unfortunately, no, it's mathematically impossible. If you divide 1 million by 2, you'd end up with50% for each line. This surpasses the 40% limit for a single line. Even if you tried splitting it as 60% -40% or 80%-20% you'd still exceed the 40% threshold in one line alone.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Absolutely, let's dive into some scenarios.</p>

                  <p class="bold mb-0">With 3 lines:</p>
                  <ul class="faq-list">
                    <li>-40%-40%-20%: Qualified</li>

                  </ul>

                  <p class="bold mb-0">With 4 lines:</p>
                  <ul class="faq-list">
                    <li>- 30%-30%-30%-10%: Qualified and on the path to millionaire status. Bravo!</li>

                    <li>- 25%-25%-25%-25% Yes!!!!Qualified</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="bold mb-0">With 5 lines:</p>
                  <ul class="faq-list">
                    <li>- 20%-20%-20%-20%-20%: Yes, qualified!</li>
                    <li>- 31%-19%-20%-20%-10%: Yes, qualified.</li>
                    <li>- 30%-30%-30%-9%-1%: Yes, qualified!</li>
                    <li>-20%-20%-45%-10%-5%- No. Not qualified</li>
                  </ul>

                    <li>- 25%-15%-15%-15%-15%-15%: Yes, qualified!</li>

                  </ul>

                  <p>Now, things get interesting. Imagine your network's sales are 1.5 million instead of the square 1 million needed for your rank 6. You wouldn't qualify for rank 7, but here's where the bonus and the 40% rule play a trick on you. Let's start with 3lines, bearing in mind that 2 lines can't mathematically qualify as we discussed earlier….</p>

                  <p class="bold mb-0">**Example: 1.5 Million in Sales**</p>
                  <p class="m-0">Let's put on our calculation hats and delve into this scenario:</p>
                  <ul class="faq-list">
                    <li><span class="bold">Line 1: </span>$900k</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Line 2: </span>$290k</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Line 3: </span>$310k</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Now, before jumping to conclusions, it might seem like a no-go because Line 1surpasses the 40% rule, right? But hold your horses! The rule applies to the initial 1million, not the excess amount. So, let's dissect this further.</p>
                  <p>Line 2 and Line 3 together, contribute to the sum of the "free volume" – the remaining 60% of the initial 1 million. When we do the math, it turns out you've...</p>
                  <p>But wait, there's more! This isn't just a pat on the back. Surprise, surprise – we're not only not penalizing you for going the extra mile, but we're also rewarding you. That's right, we're not settling for the baseline 1 million bonus. We're going full throttle and handing over the entire 1.5 million dollars.</p>
                  <p>Remember what we said? We match the first 30 days' volume and then some. You've gone above and beyond, and we're giving credit where it's due. So, myfriend, not only did you break the tape, but you did it with a grand flourish, and your reward reflects just that. Kudos to you!</p>
